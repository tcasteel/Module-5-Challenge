# Module-5-Challenge
To start off, the dataframe are needed to merge together to be able to have results that are able to have correlation.
Next using the merged dataframe, excluded the duplicate Mouse ID and its other values
Then recreated the dataframe without the duplicate mouse ID

After that ran a table with the mean, median, var, std, sem into a dataframe for the tumor size for each of the Drug Regimens.

Then created a bar chart for the drug regimons and their corresponding mouse timepoints.

Then made a pie chart for the distrubution of the male and female mice that were used in the test.

After the pie charts created a box plot with the formulas that were created before hand above the chart.

Then created a line graph of the timepoints of the tumor volume of a specific mouse ID.

Then created the scatter plot for the tumor volume and weight to see if they go hand and hand.

With the scatter plot created a correlation coefficient for the scatter plot.
